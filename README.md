# Personal Finance Management App with Django, HTMX, Alpine, Tailwind, and Plaid

This project is a personal finance management app that integrates [Plaid](https://plaid.com/) to link bank accounts and provide financial insights. I used [Plaidâ€™s official examples](https://github.com/plaid/pattern) from their repository as a reference.

- Automated webhooks to:
  - Automatically sync and update bank data whenever new transactions are available.
  - Easily update and re-authenticate accounts when they enter a bad state (e.g., login required).
